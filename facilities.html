                    made and
                    filled with water so that people can swim in it. The hotel has a heated indoor
                    swimming pool. Our swimming pool is available for fun or exercise. The outdoor swimming pool
                    is open during the summer months.The fascinating, open air swimming pool is located near a
                    tremendous ocean with its beautiful view. Swimming pool is construct with the cool blue tiles
                    that enhance the color of water in the pool. <br><br> Day is not so hot due to slight breeze
                    that touching the people faces softly. Water in the pool is blue as the sky and clean as the
                    crystal. Cool blue Water of pool is soothing the eyes and refreshing mind and body. The place
                    is busy and crowded with visitors. People there wanted to dive in the deep of water. Youngsters
                    diving in the pool with eyes closed, arms outstretched feeling their heart before feeling the
                    depth of water. Splashing of water on others seems very interesting and a great fun for children.

                       <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: red;"> Enjoy</span> a self-guided hotel-to-hotel walking holiday, 
                        with the satisfaction of walking from village to village. <br><br>
                         With no group, you can walk at your own pace, carrying only
                          what you need for the day – we arrange luggage transfers, and 
                          provide you with a map and our trusted route notes.
                          What makes inn-to-inn walking so rewarding is the sense
                           of journey. <br><br> Depending on the holiday you choose, you may
                            cover over 100 kilometres during your time away. This is very
                             fulfilling in itself, but is even more so given that you can 
                             often clearly see the landscapes changing gradually as you progress. <br><br>
                              Inn-to-inn walking also gives you the opportunity to stay at a number 
                              of different hotels along the way, providing an added sense of variety
